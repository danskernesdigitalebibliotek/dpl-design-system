# DPL Design System in Storybook

<div className="subheading">What is DPL Design System</div>

DPL Design System is a library of UI components that should be used as a common base system for "Danmarks Biblioteker" / "Det Digitale Folkebibliotek".
The design is implemented via Storybook/React and is output with HTML markup and css-classes through an addon in Storybook. <br/>
The codebase follows the naming that designers have used in Figma closely to ensure consistency.

<div className="subheading">What is storybook</div>

Storybook is an open source tool for building UI components and pages in isolation from your app's business logic, data, and context. <br/>
Storybook helps you document components for reuse and automatically visually test your components to prevent bugs. <br/>
It promotes the [**component-driven**](https://componentdriven.org) process and agile development.

It is possible to extend Storybook with an ecosystem of addons that help you do things like fine-tune responsive layouts or verify accessibility.

<div className="subheading">How to use</div>

The Storybook interface is simple and intuitive to use. Browse the project's
stories now by navigating to them in the sidebar.

The stories are placed in a flat structure, where developers should not spend
time thinking of structure, since we want to keep all parts of the system under
a heading called Library. This Library is then dividid in folders where common
parts are kept together.

To expose to the user how we think these parts stitch together for example
for the new website, we have a heading called Blocks, to resemble what cms
blocks a user can expect to find when building pages in the choosen CMS.

This could replicate in to mobile applications, newsletters etc. all pulling
parts from the Library.

Each story has a corresponding `.stories` file. View their code in the
`src/stories` directory to learn how they work.
The `stories` file is used to add the component to the Storybook interface via
the title. Start the title with "Library" or "Blocks" and use / to
divide into folders fx. `Library / Buttons / Button`

<div className="subheading">Addons</div>

Storybook ships with some essential pre-installed [**addons**](https://storybook.js.org/addons/tag/essentials/) to power the core Storybook experience.

- [**Controls**](https://storybook.js.org/addons/@storybook/addon-controls/)
- [**Actions**](https://storybook.js.org/addons/@storybook/addon-actions/)
- [**Docs**](https://storybook.js.org/addons/@storybook/addon-docs/)
- [**Viewport**](https://storybook.js.org/addons/@storybook/addon-viewport/)
- [**Backgrounds**](https://storybook.js.org/addons/@storybook/addon-backgrounds/)
- [**Toolbars**](https://storybook.js.org/addons/@storybook/addon-toolbars/)
- [**Measure**](https://storybook.js.org/addons/@storybook/addon-measure/)
- [**Outline**](https://storybook.js.org/addons/@storybook/addon-outline/)

There are many other helpful addons to customise the usage and experience.

Additional addons used for this project:

- [**HTML / storybook-addon-html**](https://storybook.js.org/addons/@whitespace/storybook-addon-html/): <br/>
  This addon is used to display compiled HTML markup for each story and make it easier for developers to grab the code.
  Because we are developing with React, it is necessary to be able to show the HTML markup with the css-classes to make it easier for other developers that will implement it in the future.
  If a story has controls the HTML markup changes according to the controls that are set.

- [**Designs / storybook-addon-designs**](https://storybook.js.org/addons/storybook-addon-designs/): <br/>
  This addon is used to embed Figma in the addon panel for a better design-development workflow.

- [**A11Y**](https://storybook.js.org/addons/@storybook/addon-a11y/): <br/>
  This addon is used to check the accessibility of the components.

All the addons can be found in `storybook/main.js` directory.

<div className="subheading">Important to notice</div>

**Internal classes** <br/>
To display some of the components (fx Colors, Spacing) in a more presentable way, we are using some "internal" css-classes which can be found in the `styles/internal.scss` file.
All css-classes with "internal" in the front should therefore be ignored in the HTML markup.
