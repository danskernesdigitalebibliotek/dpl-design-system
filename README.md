# DPL Design System
The design system provides a set of components that are developed with ```React.js``` and [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).

## Requirements
This project requires the following setup:
* ```npm >= 7```
* ```node 14``` 

Check in the terminal which versions you have installed with ```npm -v``` and ```node -v```.

If you don't have the right ```npm``` version, you can bump it with ```nvm install-latest-npm``` - which requires you to have [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) installed.

## Installation
Use the node package manager to install project dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## Storybook
Spin up storybook by running this command in the terminal:
 ```bash 
 npm run storybook
 ```
When storybook is ready it automatically opens up in a browser with the interface ready to use.

Read more about how to use storybook in the [docs](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/introduction).
