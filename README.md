# DPL Design System

DPL Design System is a library of UI components that should be used as a common
base system for "Danmarks Biblioteker" / "Det Digitale Folkebibliotek". The
design is implemented with
[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/introduction) /
[React](https://reactjs.org/) and is output with HTML markup and css-classes
through an addon in Storybook.

The codebase follows the naming that designers have used in Figma closely to
ensure consistency.
